## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Database Connection
```javascript
const { connectDB, healthCheck, getStats } = require('./src/database/database');

// Connect to database
await connectDB();

// Check health
const health = await healthCheck();
console.log(health);

// Get statistics
const stats = await getStats();
console.log(stats);
```

### Company Operations
```javascript
const Company = require('./src/components/company/company.model');

// Find active companies
const activeCompanies = await Company.findActive();

// Search companies
const searchResults = await Company.search('technology');

// Add job to company
await company.addJob(jobId);
```

### Job Operations
```javascript
const Job = require('./src/components/job/job.model');

// Find active jobs
const activeJobs = await Job.findActive();

// Search jobs with filters
const jobs = await Job.search({
    jobType: 'Full-time',
    location: 'New York',
    requiredSkills: ['JavaScript', 'React']
});

// Increment views
await job.incrementViews();
```

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### Schema Changes
- Company: Added required `industry` field
- Job: Changed `salaryRange` from array to object with min/max
- Employee: Added required `skills` array
- Application: Enhanced status enum values

### Field Renaming
- No field renames, only additions and enhancements

### Required Fields
- New required fields may cause existing data to fail validation
- Consider data migration for existing databases

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Data
1. **Backup your database** before applying changes
2. **Update existing documents** to include new required fields
3. **Test validation** with a subset of data
4. **Apply changes** in a staging environment first

### Example Migration Script
```javascript
// Update existing companies to include industry
await Company.updateMany(
    { industry: { $exists: false } },
    { $set: { industry: 'General' } }
);

// Update existing jobs to new salary range format
await Job.updateMany(
    { salaryRange: { $type: 'array' } },
    { $set: { salaryRange: { min: 0, max: 10000 } } }
);
```
